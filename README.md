JOB SCHEDULER

Job Scheduler is a program that prioritizes the tasks for an operating system based on priority. Input is taken as a file with lines of the form:
job_number priority arrival_time duration
All values in the input file are integers and each job number is unique. priority descrbes how important the job is (higher values means higher priority). arrival_time describes when the job should enter the operating system and duration describes how long the job takes to run. The program uses a priority queue to sort the tasks of the scheduler and then prints the second-by-second runtime information to the console.
