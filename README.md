Job Scheduler is a program that prioritizes the tasks for an operating system based on priority. Input is taken as a file with lines of the form: <job number> <priority> <arrival time> <duration>. All values in the input file are integers. The program uses a priority queue to sort the tasks of the scheduler and then prints the second-by-second runtime information to the console.
